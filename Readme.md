# üß† ResearchBot: News Research Tool

**ResearchBot** is a user-friendly, AI-powered news research assistant built for effortless information retrieval and analysis.  
It allows users to load news article URLs, process content through LangChain, and interact with a conversational AI (ChatGPT) to extract meaningful insights ‚Äî especially in the **stock market and financial** domains.

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ **URL & File Loading**
- Load single or multiple article URLs directly.
- Upload text files containing multiple URLs for batch processing.

‚úÖ **Smart Content Extraction**
- Uses **LangChain's UnstructuredURL Loader** to fetch and structure article content seamlessly.

‚úÖ **Intelligent Embeddings**
- Generates semantic embeddings using **OpenAI‚Äôs Embeddings API**.

‚úÖ **Efficient Similarity Search**
- Leverages **FAISS**, a high-performance vector search library, for rapid and accurate retrieval of relevant article segments.

‚úÖ **Conversational Query Interface**
- Ask questions naturally via **ChatGPT** and receive concise, contextually relevant answers.
- Each answer includes **source URLs** for transparency and reference.

üß† How It Works (High-Level Flow)
Data Ingestion: Load and extract article content from URLs using LangChain.

Text Processing: Split articles into semantically meaningful chunks.

Vectorization: Convert text chunks into embeddings via OpenAI‚Äôs Embeddings API.

Indexing: Store embeddings in FAISS for efficient similarity-based retrieval.

Query & Response: Use ChatGPT to answer user questions based on retrieved contexts, with citations.

üí° Future Enhancements
Multi-domain support (finance, health, tech, etc.)

Integration with live news APIs

Topic-wise article clustering and summaries

Multi-modal data ingestion (text, audio, video transcripts)
